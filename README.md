2. The application locates the selected movie in the dataset.
3. Movie metadata is transformed into feature vectors using **CountVectorizer**.
4. **Cosine Similarity** computes similarity scores between movies.
5. The top matching movies are selected.
6. The **TMDb API** retrieves posters, ratings, and release years.
7. Personalized recommendations are displayed instantly.
